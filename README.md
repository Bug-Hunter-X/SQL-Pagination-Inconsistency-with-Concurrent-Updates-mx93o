This repository demonstrates a common issue in SQL pagination when using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in concurrent environments.  The `bug.sql` file shows a scenario where fetching page 2 of results changes drastically after rows are added to the table.  The `bugSolution.sql` file presents potential strategies to mitigate this by using row numbers or window functions instead of relying purely on `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` for more robust paging behavior.
