In SQL, a common but subtle error arises when using `LIMIT` with `OFFSET` for pagination.  If the table is updated concurrently while fetching paginated data, inconsistencies can occur.  Imagine fetching page 2 (OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10) and then inserting many new rows. The next request for page 2 might return completely different results because the row indices change after insertion. The code looks correct, but the result is unpredictable.
